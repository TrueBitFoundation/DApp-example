# Example web application

This example uses a web browser to submit a Truebit task to Rinkeby testnet.  At least one Solver (JIT) is currently running on Rinkeby.  The example returns the Solver's solution in the web browser.  Here are the steps to try it out.

1. Install [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) extension for your browser.

2. Get some Rinkeby ETH from [this faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/).

3. Log in to Metamask, and choose an application!

(a) Compute an Scrypt hash:
http://176.9.9.249:3000/app/

(b) Compute a bilinear map:
http://176.9.9.249:3000/samples/pairing/public/

The solution may take a few minutes to appear in the browser.  You can check progress on the blockchain here: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xe36c6ce04b2faa481087cefa05fc5b9d7e385eed.
